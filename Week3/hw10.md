Homework 10
Audit 1

---

QUESTION 1
Imagine you have been given the following code to audit:

    // SPDX-License-Identifier: MIT
    pragma solidity ^0.8.4;
    import "@openzeppelin/contracts/token/ERC20/ERC20.sol";

    contract DogCoinGame is ERC20 {
        uint256 public currentPrize;
        uint256 public numberPlayers;
        address payable[] public players;
        address payable[] public winners;

        event startPayout();

        constructor() ERC20("DogCoin", "DOG") {}

        function addPlayer(address payable _player) public payable {
            if (msg.value == 1) {
                players.push(_player);
            }
            numberPlayers++;
            if (numberPlayers > 200) {
                emit startPayout();
            }
        }

        function addWinner(address payable _winner) public {
            winners.push(_winner);
        }

        function payout() public {
            if (address(this).balance == 100) {
                uint256 amountToPay = winners.length / 100;
                payWinners(amountToPay);
            }
        }

        function payWinners(uint256 _amount) public {
            for (uint256 i = 0; i <= winners.length; i++) {
                winners[i].send(_amount);
            }
        }
    }

With the following note from the team:

"DogCoinGame is a game where players are added to the
contract via the addPlayer function, they need to send 1 ETH
to play.
Once 200 players have entered, the UI will be notified by the
startPayout event, and will pick 100 winners which will be
added to the winners array, the UI will then call the payout
function to pay each of the winners.
The remaining balance will be kept as profit for the
developers."

Write out the main points that you would include in an audit
report.

--REPORT--:

Purpose of the Contract:

Scope of the Audit:

    The Scope was limited to the functionality of the included contract as it stands. There are a total of 4 state variables, 2 being dynamic. There is one event and one constructor. There are an additional 4 functions.

Analysis:

    1 - instead of .send use the transfer function:

    winners[i].send(_amount);

    2 -

QUESTION 2
DIFFICULT
Underhanded Solidity
Meant to look benign but is not...

This contract is the winner of this years underhanded solidity
contest, it mimics the OpenSea application.
Can you spot the flaws in it
⛽🏌This is a gas-golfed version of Zora v3's Offers module!
🤩 A bidder can call createBid to bid on the NFT of their
dreams.
💰 The NFT owner can call acceptBid to accept one of these
on-chain bids.
🤝 Assets exchange hands.
😤 What could possibly go wrong?

Hints
Look at the Solmate contracts used, and the way
transferFrom is implemented.
