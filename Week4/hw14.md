---

**QUESTION 1**
What are the potential dangers when performing the
following bitwise operations

- Left Shift
- Right Shift

Overflows, Underflows, and if used with memory operations, memory errors.

**QUESTION 2**
Bit Operations

Imagine you have a uint256 variable in storage named x
check if x starts with de or be
if x starts with 0xde multiply x by 4
if x starts with 0xbe divide x by 4

Write the code in

- Solidity
- Yul

Which one is most gas efficient ?

To help you test your solution, here are some decimal values
you can use

    uint256 beValue = 86177475670493197073919501659849812897660611100807883281033508768520888346190;
    uint256 deValue = 100651486825157721501865874785935801379319359184012953785965706769510029551182;
