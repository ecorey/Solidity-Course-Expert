**QUESTION 3**
Discuss in your teams how you can mitigate MEV, and
should we do so ?

MEV exploits involve monitoring the mempool for pending transactions, then front-running, back-running, or sandwiching these transactions by creating new transactions with higher gas prices to ensure they are mined first. This way, they can exploit arbitrage opportunities or other profit-generating activities at the expense of regular users.

Techniques that mitigate MEV aim to reduce the potential for such exploitative behaviors, improving fairness and efficiency in the system. Four ways in which MEV can be mitigated is:

1. Transaction Reordering Protection: By setting protocols that fix the order of transactions, miners are deterred from reordering them to exploit arbitrage opportunities.

2. MEV Auctions: Users bid for transaction placement, making it less predictable for miners to know which transactions to exploit, hence reducing arbitrage opportunities.

3. Flashbots: By creating a transparent and fairer system for transaction inclusion, it reduces the incentives for miners to engage in harmful MEV activities.

4. Commit-Reveal Schemes: By hiding transaction details until a later time, miners are unable to see and exploit valuable transactions in the mempool.

**QUESTION 4**
Look through the code for the MEV bot Sandwich
contract
Do you understand what the assembly code is doing ?

**QUESTION 5**
See if you can listen to the mempool using ether.js (or
similar web3.py etc)

See Repo at: (currently private):

**QUESTION 6**
Can you find a way to filter your mempool listener and
get only uniswap transactions?
