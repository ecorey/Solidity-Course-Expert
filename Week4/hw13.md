**QUESTION 3**
Discuss in your teams how you can mitigate MEV, and
should we do so ?

MEV exploits involve monitoring the mempool for pending transactions, then front-running, back-running, or sandwiching these transactions by creating new transactions with higher gas prices to ensure they are mined first. This way, they can exploit arbitrage opportunities or other profit-generating activities at the expense of regular users.

Techniques that mitigate MEV aim to reduce the potential for such exploitative behaviors, improving fairness and efficiency in the system. Four ways in which MEV can be mitigated is:

1. Transaction Reordering Protection: By setting protocols that fix the order of transactions, miners are deterred from reordering them to exploit arbitrage opportunities.

2. MEV Auctions: Users bid for transaction placement, making it less predictable for miners to know which transactions to exploit, hence reducing arbitrage opportunities.

3. Flashbots: By creating a transparent and fairer system for transaction inclusion, it reduces the incentives for miners to engage in harmful MEV activities.

4. Commit-Reveal Schemes: By hiding transaction details until a later time, miners are unable to see and exploit valuable transactions in the mempool.

**QUESTION 4**
Look through the code for the MEV bot Sandwich
contract
Do you understand what the assembly code is doing ?

    https://github.com/libevm/subway/blob/master/contracts/src/Sandwich.sol

The provided contract code defines a smart contract Sandwich that facilitates a type of front-running attack known as a sandwich attack. In such attacks, malicious actors watch the mempool for profitable transactions, then create two transactions of their own to "sandwich" the targeted transaction, benefiting from price changes.

The assembly block in the fallback function orchestrates a sandwich attack by first transferring tokens to a pair contract, then executing a swap on that pair.

    assembly {
        // Verify caller is authorized
        if iszero(eq(caller(), memUser)) {
            revert(3, 3)  // Revert if unauthorized
        }

        // Extract variables from call data
        let token := shr(96, calldataload(0x00))  // Extract token address
        let pair := shr(96, calldataload(0x14))   // Extract pair address
        let amountIn := shr(128, calldataload(0x28))  // Extract input amount
        let amountOut := shr(128, calldataload(0x38)) // Extract output amount
        let tokenOutNo := shr(248, calldataload(0x48)) // Extract token output number

        // Prepare call to token.transfer function
        mstore(0x7c, ERC20_TRANSFER_ID)  // Load transfer function signature
        mstore(0x80, pair)  // Load destination address
        mstore(0xa0, amountIn)  // Load amount to transfer

        // Call token.transfer and check for success
        let s1 := call(sub(gas(), 5000), token, 0, 0x7c, 0x44, 0, 0)
        if iszero(s1) {
            revert(3, 3)  // Revert if call fails
        }

        // Prepare call to pair.swap function
        mstore(0x7c, PAIR_SWAP_ID)  // Load swap function signature
        // Set input and output amounts based on tokenOutNo
        switch tokenOutNo
        case 0 {
            mstore(0x80, amountOut)
            mstore(0xa0, 0)
        }
        case 1 {
            mstore(0x80, 0)
            mstore(0xa0, amountOut)
        }
        mstore(0xc0, address())  // Load caller address
        mstore(0xe0, 0x80)  // Load empty bytes data

        // Call pair.swap and check for success
        let s2 := call(sub(gas(), 5000), pair, 0, 0x7c, 0xa4, 0, 0)
        if iszero(s2) {
            revert(3, 3)  // Revert if call fails
        }
    }

**QUESTION 5**
See if you can listen to the mempool using ether.js (or
similar web3.py etc)

See Repo at: (currently private):

[Mempool Listen](https://github.com/ecorey/MempoolMonitor)

**QUESTION 6**
Can you find a way to filter your mempool listener and
get only uniswap transactions?
